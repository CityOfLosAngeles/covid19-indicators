# Public Health Research
Collection of articles to guide the reopening strategy. Provides context for **what we have learned and what we still don't know** about the coronavirus, what the trajectory of the pandemic might be over the next year, and how we should build up our public health capacity. 

Examples of reopening indicators used by NY and Chicago are included for LA to benchmark its own progress. References for CA and LA's own reopening indicators are also included.

    * By late July, CA is estimated to have 1,000 deaths per day without further mitigation
    * The [R0, or reproduction number](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/world/europe/coronavirus-R0-explainer.html), which shows how fast the virus is spreading, is still above 1 in these 24 states.
    * In CA, seeing a plateau of cases, but not decreases, suggests that [R0 is hovering close to 1](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/5/16/21254748/california-coronavirus-cases-lockdown), where virus spread is sustained, and each infected person infects 1 person, on average.
    * Leading CA health official [warns that CA is making modifications toward reopening too quickly](https://www.planetizen.com/news/2020/05/109462-reopening-california-respected-county-health-official-issues-warning)
* As of early June, the [world rushes to reopen](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-reopenings.html) even as caseloads are rising, including [21 US states](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/us/politics/coronavirus-washington-trump.html), and we can't wish [the virus away by reopening](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/6/11/21285077/covid-19-arizona-texas-next-wave).
    * How coronavirus compares to [100 years of deadly events](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/10/world/coronavirus-history.html) 
    * [8 states](https://www.vox.com/2020/6/10/21286696/us-covid-19-coronavirus-cases-update-texas-arizona-north-carolina) that are the next hotspots, and TX, FL, CA are the [states that saw the largest increases in cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/world/coronavirus-live-updates.html) in the [past week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/world/coronavirus-live-updates.html)

* Polls show that [whites are increasingly ready to reopen, but Blacks are not](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/black-americans-were-hit-hard-by-state-shutdowns-but-are-worried-about-reopening-too/).



## Are We Past the Peak?
* [Lockdowns 1 week earlier](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/us/coronavirus-distancing-deaths.html) would have prevented 36,000 deaths in the US). 
    * Deaths in LA County by May 3 estimated to be 451 instead of 1,223 if we stayed at home 1 week earlier. 
* University of Minnesota and Harvard studies on [possible trajectories of the pandemic into late 2020 and 2021](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/health/coronavirus-pandemic-curve-scenarios.html) shows that a one-time social distancing effort is not sufficient to control this in the long term. Experts recommend turning social distancing on and off depending on case levels. 
    * Germany says [regions must reinstate restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/opinion/germany-coronavirus-reopening.html) if cases pass a certain threshold.
* [Are any countries close to herd immunity? Not even close.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/28/upshot/coronavirus-herd-immunity.html)


## Building Public Health Capacity
 * We aren't [testing enough](https://www.vox.com/2020/5/8/21249880/coronavirus-testing-covid-reopening-economy-lockdowns-social-distancing) nor have [enough contact tracers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/health/coronavirus-second-wave-infections.html) to manage the current caseloads.
 * [What experts say is necessary for a national testing strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/health/coronavirus-testing-trump.html):
    * 10% positive share for mitigation
    * 4% positive share to halt virus spread
 * [Open, transparent, and public data](https://amp.floridatoday.com/amp/5212398002) is crucial for agencies and researchers to simultaneously learn about the virus and tackle the outbreaks from multiple fronts. 
 * [Reporting all-cause mortality and testing the high risk](https://www.vox.com/2020/5/26/21270703/coronavirus-deaths-us-world-covid-19-nursing-homes) are ways to move forward, since deaths are [likely undercounted](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/19/us/us-coronavirus-covid-death-toll.html).
 * [Summary of what we've learned](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html): always wear masks, we can't depend on herd immunity, and we can't count on warmer weather alone.
 * [Philisophical differences](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/biden-trump-coronavirus-testing.html) between state-led strategy vs federal strategy
    * [Biden's national coronavirus plan](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6927667-COVID-National-Diagnostics-Strategy-05-24-2020-v.html#document/p2)


## Antibodies and Immunity Research
* Germany's research on [who has antibodies, how long antibodies last after infection, and what levels of antibodies are needed to prevent re-infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/world/europe/with-broad-random-tests-for-antibodies-germany-seeks-path-out-of-lockdown.html)
* [How long do antibodies last?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html) Remains to be seen.
    * Spain, with one of the worst outbreaks in Europe, [only sees about 5% of its population with immunity](https://www.vox.com/2020/5/16/21259492/covid-antibodies-spain-serology-study-coronavirus-immunity) and in [NYC, with the worst US outbreak](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/28/upshot/coronavirus-herd-immunity.html), about 20% of its population.
    * Antibodies don't last longer [than a couple months](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/health/coronavirus-antibodies.html), and its role in preventing re-infection is not yet clear. But, studies show that asymptomatic people are shedding the virus for potentially longer periods of time than symptomatic people.


## Known Unknowns 
* [How indoor ventilation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/health/airflow-coronavirus-restaurants.html) affects the path of virus infection, possibly spreading [through ducts](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0764_article#tnF1).
* How long does [virus linger through air?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/health/coronavirus-infections.html)

    * Arguably, [LA is more similar to NYC and Chicago](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/coronavirus-chicago.html) than other regions due to persistent caseloads that are flattening, but not dropping. As Chicago's benchmarks are tougher than the rest of IL, and it should be so for LA than the rest of CA.
