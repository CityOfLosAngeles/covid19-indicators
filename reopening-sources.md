# Public Health Research
Collection of articles to guide the reopening strategy. Provides context for what we have learned and what we still don't know about the coronavirus, what the trajectory of the pandemic might be over the next year, and how we should build up our public health capacity. Examples of reopening indicators used by NY and Chicago are included for LA to benchmark its own progress.

## Dangers of Reopening Too Early
* Rushed reopenings are [a global trial-and-error experiment](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/world/europe/coronavirus-reopening-costs.html) 
* NYT analysis showing how US states reopening [fail to meet the WH guidelines](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/us/coronavirus-states-reopen-criteria.html)
    * Track the state's status of reopening [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html).
    * More cases in US states that reopened: [Georgia](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/24/opinion/coronavirus-covid-19-georgia-reopen.html), [Texas](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/05/14/coronavirus-updates-texas/), and on average, seems to be true for [places outside NYC](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/us/coronavirus-united-states.html)
    * More cases in countries that reopened: [Japan, South Korea](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/covid-19-countries-that-have-already-reopened-lessons#How-Germany-is-reopening), Singapore, [Lebanon](https://healthpolicy-watch.org/countries-that-reopen-early-may-have-waves-of-lockdowns/) and [Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/world/middleeast/iran-coronavirus-surge.html)
* Contrary to popular belief, a [survey of expert economists](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/policy-for-the-covid-19-crisis/) shows support for a [large contraction of economic activity until the spread of infections has dropped significantly](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/opinion/coronavirus-reopen-economy.html).
* [What experts say is necessary for a national testing strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/health/coronavirus-testing-trump.html).
    * 10% positive share is enough for mitigation
    * 4% positive share needed to halt the spread of virus
* As of late May, [24 US states have uncontrolled virus spread](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/study-estimates-24-states-still-have-uncontrolled-coronavirus-spread/2020/05/22/d3032470-9c43-11ea-ac72-3841fcc9b35f_story.html)
    * By late July, CA is estimated to have 1,000 deaths per day without further mitigation
    * The [R0, or reproduction number](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/world/europe/coronavirus-R0-explainer.html), which shows how fast the virus is spreading, is still above 1 in these 24 states.
    * In CA, seeing a plateau of cases, but not decreases, suggests that [R0 is hovering close to 1](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/5/16/21254748/california-coronavirus-cases-lockdown), where virus spread is sustained, and each infected person infects 1 person, on average.

## Are We Past the Peak?
* [Lockdowns 1 week earlier](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/us/coronavirus-distancing-deaths.html) would have prevented 36,000 deaths in the US). 
    * Deaths in LA County by May 3 estimated to be 451 instead of 1,223 if we stayed at home 1 week earlier. 
* University of Minnesota and Harvard studies on [possible trajectories of the pandemic into late 2020 and 2021](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/health/coronavirus-pandemic-curve-scenarios.html) shows that a one-time social distancing effort is not sufficient to control this in the long term. Experts recommend turning social distancing on and off depending on case levels. 
    * Germany says [regions must reinstate restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/opinion/germany-coronavirus-reopening.html) if cases pass a certain threshold.
* [Are any countries close to herd immunity? Not even close.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/28/upshot/coronavirus-herd-immunity.html)


## Building Public Health Capacity
 * We aren't [testing enough](https://www.vox.com/2020/5/8/21249880/coronavirus-testing-covid-reopening-economy-lockdowns-social-distancing) nor have [enough contact tracers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/health/coronavirus-second-wave-infections.html) to manage the current caseloads.
 * [Open, transparent, and public data](https://amp.floridatoday.com/amp/5212398002) is crucial for agencies and researchers to simultaneously learn about the virus and tackle the outbreaks from multiple fronts. 
 * [Reporting all-cause mortality and testing the high risk](https://www.vox.com/2020/5/26/21270703/coronavirus-deaths-us-world-covid-19-nursing-homes) are ways to move forward.
 * [Philisophical differences](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/biden-trump-coronavirus-testing.html) between state-led strategy vs federal strategy
    * [Biden's national coronavirus plan](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6927667-COVID-National-Diagnostics-Strategy-05-24-2020-v.html#document/p2)


## Antibodies and Immunity Research

* [How long do antibodies last? Remains to be seen.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html)

* [11 things we still don't know](https://www.vox.com/2020/5/12/21248395/coronavirus-pandemic-covid-symptoms-testing-children-mysteries) from number of cases, scaled up testing, impact on children, and the types of social distancing that can work as we reopen
* [Legionnaires' a potential health threat](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-legionnaires-offices.html) for dormant office buildings
* [Reconfigured office space](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/14/21211789/coronavirus-office-space-work-from-home-design-architecture-real-estate) with higher air filtration, more cleaning high touch surfaces, and UV light to kill germs


## The Path Toward Reopening
* [Reuters: Reopening plans are all over the map](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-states-analysi/new-cases-deaths-u-s-states-reopening-plans-are-all-over-the-map-idUSKBN22U2U2)
* [Vox: What works - more masks, testing, stimulus money, etc](https://www.vox.com/2020/5/13/21248157/testing-quarantine-masks-stimulus)
* White House [Opening Up America Again gating criteria](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Guidelines-for-Opening-Up-America-Again.pdf) 
    * [NY State's](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/nyregion/coronavirus-reopen-cuomo-ny.html) and [Chicago's](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-chicago-reopening-lightfoot-20200508-ztpnouwexrcvfdfcr2yccbc53a-story.html) reopening indicators.
    * Arguably, [LA is more similar to NYC and Chicago](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/coronavirus-chicago.html) than other regions due to persistent caseloads that are flattening, but not dropping. As Chicago's benchmarks are tougher than the rest of IL, and it should be so for LA than the rest of CA.
