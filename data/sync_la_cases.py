    These columns are read in with Excel formulas...
    There is some reallocation of new_cases and new_deaths.
    If cases are stable over 3 days, then the new_cases is reallocated and split across 3 days. 
    Valid approach used by experts, especially since confirmed cases are a function of tests conducted.
    However, we already use a 7-day rolling average to smooth out the day to day fluctuations.

    What are the implications of splitting across days, then doing a rolling average on top of that?
    Numbers will seem even more deflated?

    For now, let's create new_cases and new_deaths again, and then apply 7-day rolling average.
