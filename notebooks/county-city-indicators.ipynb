    "## LA's COVID-19 Reopening Indicators \n",
    "This report contains information about how LA County and the City of LA performed yesterday, on a number of key COVID-19 indicators related to the speed at which opening up can occur. Taken together, performing well against the benchmarks provide confidence in moving through each phase of reopening. \n",
    "\n",

    "* By mid Jan 2021, it is estimated that [1 in 3](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-14/one-in-three-la-county-residents-infected-coronavirus) already have had COVID in LA County, triple the confirmed/reported cases.\n",
    "* By early Jan 2021, it is estimated that [1 in 17 people currently have COVID in LA County](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Los-Angeles-County-COVID-data-1-in-17-hospitals-15848658.php)\n",
    "* By late Dec, southern CA and central CA have [run out of ICU beds](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/26/world/central-and-southern-california-icu-capacity.html)\n",
    "* In mid Dec, LA County Department of Public Health [estimated that 1 in 80 people were infectious](http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1082410_COVID-19ProjectionPublicUpdateLewis12.16.20English.pdf)\n",
    "* LA reaches [5,000 deaths](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-11/13000-more-coronavirus-cases-california-test-results-backlog) by mid-August, and is ranked as 3rd highest US county in terms of deaths, after Queens (NY) and Kings (NY) Counties.\n",
    "* LA County is [projected](https://www.planetizen.com/news/2020/07/109756-californias-coronavirus-infections-and-hospitalizations-surge) to [run out](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-29/l-a-county-issues-dire-warning-amid-alarming-increases-in-coronavirus) of ICU beds by early to mid July, with acute care beds [reaching capacity](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/health/coronavirus-mortality-testing.html) soon after. \n",
    "* In late June, LA County Department of Public Health (DPH) [estimated that 1 in 400 people were infectious](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-29/o-c-reports-highest-weekly-covid-19-death-toll-as-california-sees-spike-in-cases), asymptomatic, and not isolated. One week later, as of June 29, LA DPH estimated the risk increased threefold, up to [1 in 140](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "As long as LA consistently tests large portions of its population with fairly low positive COVID-19 results, sustains decreases in cases and deaths, has stable or decreasing COVID-related hospitalizations, and stocks ample available hospital equipment for a potential surge, we are positioned to continue loosening restrictions. When any one indicator fails to meet the benchmark, we should slow down to consider why that is happening. When multiple indicators fail to meet the benchmark, we should pause our reopening plans and even enact more stringent physical and social distancing protocols by moving back a phase.     \n",

    "LA County's data, though subject to a time lag, does report the number of positive tests per testing batch. We aggregate the results by week. Only weeks with all 7 days of data available is used for the chart, which means the current week is excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart compares the percent of positive test results, the number of positive cases, and the number of tests conducted. The percent of positive test results is the indicator of interest, but it is extremely dependent on the number of tests conducted. A higher percentage of positive tests can be due to more confirmed cases or fewer tests conducted. Therefore, the next chart shows the number of tests conducted each week (blue) and the number of positive tests (gray). It also shows the testing upper and lower bounds, which is simply the daily testing upper and lower bounds multiplied by 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Interpret Results**\n",
    "1. If the number of positive tests and the percent of positive tests increase while daily testing is conducted at a similar level, there is increased transmission of the virus.\n",
    "1. If we keep up our daily testing levels yet see a corresponding drop in the share of positive tests and the number of positive cases, we are curbing the asymptomatic transmission of the virus. \n",
    "1. If daily testing drops and we see a corresponding drop in positive test results, the decrease in positive results is due to a lack of testing, not because there is less hidden, community transmission of the virus.\n",
    "1. If daily testing is stable or increasing, the share of positive tests is stable or decreasing, yet the number of positive cases is growing, then our tests are finding the new cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**CA's weekly COVID-19 positive share requirement is that tests coming back positive is 8% or below** *(upper bound)*, but experts say that [less than 4% positive](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/health/coronavirus-testing-trump.html) is necessary to halt the spread of the virus *(lower bound)*. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Caveat 1:* Testing data for city only counts tests done at city sites. Oral swabs are used by county/city sites, which have an approximate 10% false negative rate. On average, 10% of negative tests are falsely identified to be negative when they are actually positive. At the county level, we do have information on total number of tests, which include county/city sites and private healthcare providers (anyone who provides electronic data reporting), such as Kaiser Permanente. We use the [Tests by Date](http://dashboard.publichealth.lacounty.gov/covid19_surveillance_dashboard/) table. There is a time lag in results reported, and we are not sure if this lag is 3, 5, or 7 days for the results from an entire testing batch to come back.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Caveat 2:* The situation on-the-ground is important for contextualizing the data's interpretation. When testing capacity is stretched and [testing is rationed](https://calmatters.org/health/coronavirus/2020/07/california-new-coronavirus-testing-guidelines/), those who are able to obtain tests are more likely to test positive. This distorts the share of positive results, and we expect the positivity rate to increase when we target the riskiest subgroups. We are excluding a subset of cases that would test positive, if testing supplies were available. Factoring in the high false negative rate from oral swabs used at county/city sites, we are **undercounting the actual number of cases, but are observing trends from the riskiest or most vulnerable subgroups**."
