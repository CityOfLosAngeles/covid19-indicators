    "## LA's COVID-19 Reopening Indicators \n",
    "This report contains information about how LA County and LA City performed, compared to yesterday, on a number of key COVID-19 indicators related to the speed at which opening up can occur. Taken together, performing well against the benchmarks provide confidence in moving through each phase of reopening. \n",
    "\n",
    "As long as LA consistently tests large portions of its population with fairly low positive COVID-19 results, sustains decreases in caseloads and deaths, and stocks ample available hospital equipment for a potential surge, we are positioned to continue loosening restrictions. When any one indicator fails to meet the benchmark, we should slow down to consider why that is happening. When multiple indicators fail to meet the benchmark, we should pause our reopening plans and possibly enact more stringent physical and social distancing protocols by moving back a phrase.     \n",

    "#### Daily Testing\n",
    "LA County's goal is to conduct an average of 15,000 tests a day, a rate of 45 tests per 1,000 residents *(lower\n",
    "bound)*. Chicago, another region faced with a severe outbreak, set the precedent for regional benchmarks being more stringent than statewide requirements if a particular region underwent a more severe outbreak. Chicago's goal is 50 tests per 1,000 residents, or 16,667 tests per day *(upper bound)*. The daily testing requirement is that we are conducting at least 15,000 tests daily until a vaccine is ready. The City of LA's goal is simply half of LA County's goal; 7,500 tests and 8,339 tests as the lower and upper bounds, respectively. The summary table shows whether we hit this benchmark yesterday; <span style = 'color:red'>below 15,000 (county) or below 7,500 (city) means we failed to meet this benchmark.</span> \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Share of Positive COVID-19 Test Results by Week\n",
    "Ideally, the positive/negative results per batch are calculated. Without this granular data, testing and case data are combined by week to account for any time lags. One caveat is that testing data is only available for tests conducted at county and city sites (oral swabs, which have around a 10% false negative rate, translating to an average of 10% of negative tests false identified because they are actually COVID-positive). We do not have information on the number of tests conducted by healthcare providers, such as Kaiser Permanente. However, we do have the number of confirmed cases. Hence, our numerator is complete, but our denominator is likely too small, leading to overestimating the share of positive results. However, LA County's own official reports of the share of positive results likely underestimate, because of the high false negative rate from the oral swabs used at all the county and city sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart compares the percent of positive test results, the number of positive cases, and the number of tests conducted. The percent of positive test results is the indicator of interest, but it is extremely dependent on the number of tests conducted. A higher percentage of positive tests can be due to more confirmed cases or fewer tests conducted. Therefore, the next chart shows the number of tests conducted each week (blue) and the number of positive tests (gray). It also shows the testing upper and lower bounds, which is simply the daily testing upper and lower bounds multiplied by 7.\n",

    "1. If the number of positive tests and the percent of positive tests increase while daily testing is conducted at a similar level, there is increased transmission of the virus.\n",
    "1. If we keep up our daily testing levels yet see a corresponding drop in the share of positive tests and the number of positive cases, we are curbing the asymptomatic transmission of the virus. \n",
    "1. If daily testing drops and we see a corresponding drop in positive test results, the decrease in positive results is due to a lack of testing, not because there is less hidden, community transmission of the virus.\n",

    "LA County's goal is have 20% of available ventilators and 10% ICU beds available in case of any potential surge in hospitalizations. New York City, the region faced with the most severe outbreak, set a benchmark of having at least 30% of hospital equipment available. LA County's own goal of 10% ICU beds available is far too low; we've hovered around 10% of ICU beds available since 4/15/20. Arguably, proof that the virus is indeed decreasing should mean more ICU beds freed up as we move toward reopening and preparing for any potential surge.\n",

An increase in the percent of available equipment must be matched with an increase in the number of available equipment for adequate preparation against a future surge.
