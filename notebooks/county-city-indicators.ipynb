    "## LA's COVID-19 Reopening Indicators \n",
    "This report contains information about how LA County and the City of LA performed yesterday, on a number of key COVID-19 indicators related to the speed at which opening up can occur. Taken together, performing well against the benchmarks provide confidence in moving through each phase of reopening. \n",
    "\n",
    "**LA is certainly an epicenter. In late June, LA County Department of Public Health (DPH) [estimated that 1 in 400 people were infectious](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-29/o-c-reports-highest-weekly-covid-19-death-toll-as-california-sees-spike-in-cases), asymptomatic, and not isolated. One week later, as of June 29, LA DPH estimated the risk increased threefold, up to [1 in 140](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html).**\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as LA consistently tests large portions of its population with fairly low positive COVID-19 results, sustains decreases in cases and deaths, has stable or decreasing COVID-related hospitalizations, and stocks ample available hospital equipment for a potential surge, we are positioned to continue loosening restrictions. When any one indicator fails to meet the benchmark, we should slow down to consider why that is happening. When multiple indicators fail to meet the benchmark, we should pause our reopening plans and even enact more stringent physical and social distancing protocols by moving back a phase.     \n",

    "#### Share of Positive COVID-19 Test Results by Week\n",
    "Ideally, the positive/negative results per batch are calculated. Without this granular data, testing and case data are combined by week to account for any time lags. \n",
    "\n",
    "The chart compares the percent of positive test results, the number of positive cases, and the number of tests conducted. The percent of positive test results is the indicator of interest, but it is extremely dependent on the number of tests conducted. A higher percentage of positive tests can be due to more confirmed cases or fewer tests conducted. Therefore, the next chart shows the number of tests conducted each week (blue) and the number of positive tests (gray). It also shows the testing upper and lower bounds, which is simply the daily testing upper and lower bounds multiplied by 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Interpret Results**\n",
    "1. If the number of positive tests and the percent of positive tests increase while daily testing is conducted at a similar level, there is increased transmission of the virus.\n",
    "1. If we keep up our daily testing levels yet see a corresponding drop in the share of positive tests and the number of positive cases, we are curbing the asymptomatic transmission of the virus. \n",
    "1. If daily testing drops and we see a corresponding drop in positive test results, the decrease in positive results is due to a lack of testing, not because there is less hidden, community transmission of the virus.\n",
    "1. If daily testing is stable or increasing, the share of positive tests is stable or decreasing, yet the number of positive cases is growing, then our tests are finding the new cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**CA's weekly COVID-19 positive share requirement is that tests coming back positive is 8% or below** *(upper bound)*, but experts say that [less than 4% positive](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/health/coronavirus-testing-trump.html) is necessary to halt the spread of the virus *(lower bound)*. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Caveat:* Testing data is only available for tests conducted at county and city sites.  Oral swabs are used by county/city sites, which have an approximate 10% false negative rate. On average, 10% of negative tests are falsely identified to be negative when they are actually positive. We do not have information on the number of tests conducted by healthcare providers, such as Kaiser Permanente. However, we do have the number of confirmed cases. Hence, our numerator is complete, but our denominator is likely too small, leading to overestimating the share of positive results. However, LA County's own official reports of the share of positive results likely underestimate, because of the high false negative rate from the oral swabs used at all the county/city sites."

    "#### Hospital Equipment Availability\n",
    "LA County's goal is have 20% of available ventilators and 10% ICU beds available in case of any potential surge in hospitalizations. New York City, the region faced with the most severe outbreak, set a benchmark of having at least 30% of hospital equipment available. LA County's own goal of 10% ICU beds available is far too low; we've hovered around 10% of ICU beds available since 4/15/20. Arguably, proof that the virus is indeed decreasing should mean more ICU beds freed up as we move toward reopening and preparing for any potential surge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The percentage of available equipment must be shown alongside the number of available equipment. An increase in the percent of available equipment must be matched with an increase in the number of available equipment for adequate preparation against a future surge. An increase in the percent of available equipment accompanied by a decrease in the number of available equipment simply means we have *more* of our *smaller* pool of resources. Constant denominators are used: 17,000 Acute Care Beds, 2,500 ICU Beds, and 3,200 Ventilators.\n",
    "\n",
    "CA guidelines state that hospitals must be able to accommodate a minimum surge of 35% due to COVID-19 patients, in addition to providing usual care for non-COVID-19 patients. To adjust for our HavBed data only covering the 70 largest hospitals in the county, the **hospital equipment requirement is set at 30%.** "
