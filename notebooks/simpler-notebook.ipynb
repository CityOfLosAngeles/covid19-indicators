    "## LA's COVID-19 Reopening Indicators \n",
    "This report contains information about how LA County and the City of LA performed yesterday, on a number of key COVID-19 indicators related to the speed at which opening up can occur. Taken together, performing well against the benchmarks provide confidence in moving through each phase of reopening. \n",
    "\n",
    "**LA is certainly an epicenter. In late June, LA County Department of Public Health (DPH) [estimated that 1 in 400 people were infectious](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-29/o-c-reports-highest-weekly-covid-19-death-toll-as-california-sees-spike-in-cases), asymptomatic, and not isolated. One week later, as of June 29, LA DPH estimated the risk increased threefold, up to [1 in 140](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html).** LA County is [projected](https://www.planetizen.com/news/2020/07/109756-californias-coronavirus-infections-and-hospitalizations-surge) to [run out](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-29/l-a-county-issues-dire-warning-amid-alarming-increases-in-coronavirus) of ICU beds by early to mid July, with acute care beds [reaching capacity](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/health/coronavirus-mortality-testing.html) soon after. **LA reaches [5,000 deaths](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-11/13000-more-coronavirus-cases-california-test-results-backlog) by mid-August, and is ranked as 3rd highest US county in terms of deaths**, after Queens (NY) and Kings (NY) Counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as LA consistently tests large portions of its population with fairly low positive COVID-19 results, sustains decreases in cases and deaths, has stable or decreasing COVID-related hospitalizations, and stocks ample available hospital equipment for a potential surge, we are positioned to continue loosening restrictions. When any one indicator fails to meet the benchmark, we should slow down to consider why that is happening. When multiple indicators fail to meet the benchmark, we should pause our reopening plans and even enact more stringent physical and social distancing protocols by moving back a phase.     \n",

    "CA's [Blueprint for a Safer Economy](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx) assigns each county to a tier based on case rate and test positivity rate. If counties fall into 2 different tiers on the two metrics, they are assigned to the more restrictive tier. Tiers, from most severe to least severe, categorizes coronavirus spread as <strong><span style='color:#6B1F84'>widespread; </span></strong>\n",
    "<strong><span style='color:#F3324C'>substantial; </span></strong><strong><span style='color:#F7AE1D'>moderate; </span></strong><strong><span style = 'color:#D0E700'>or minimal.</span></strong>\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Daily Testing**: number of daily tests conducted for the county 2 days ago (accounting for a time lag in results reported). LA County's goal is to test 15,000 daily (45 tests per 1,000 residents) *(lower bound)*. Chicago's goal was 50 tests per 1,000 residents, translating to 16,667 tests daily *(upper bound)*. \n",

    "\n",
    "* **Positive Tests (WHO)**: proportion of positive tests in the past 2 weeks, values fall between 0 and 1. The weeks are weighted by the number of tests conducted. The WHO recommends that tests return less than 5% positive for 14 days prior to reopening. JHU has a [state-by-state analysis](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/testing-positivity) of this. \n",
    "<span style = 'color:red'>More than 5% positive over two weeks means we failed to meet this benchmark.</span> \n",
